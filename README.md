# Description

This repository contains the project for the Software Architecture subject.
The purpose of the project is create a web application for the town hall, to manage a proposals service. The main goal is to share proposals with the town people throught this service, with the posibility of make comments, vote them or send other proposals. The council staff use this service to take in account the better proposals. To do that the service provides information and statistics of the proposals in the database in real time.

# Service

When you start the service, you have two links to use it:
- [Participants service](http://localhost:8080/participants_i3a). In this link, you can manage your account.
- [Dashboard service](http://localhost:8080/dashboard_i3a). In this link, you can manage the proposals information.

To use these services, the first thing you have to do is provide some credentials to access. If you don't have any credentials, you can't use the web application.


# Stakeholders

    2. Students that develop the assigment.
    3. Students that develop the other part of the assigment.
